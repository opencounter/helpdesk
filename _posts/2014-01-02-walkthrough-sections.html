<h3>Admin Walkthrough: The "Sections" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Sections are broad groups of Pages. Their primary purpose is to help applicants understand what kinds of information they’ll be asked to provide. They also serve as milestones for applicant as they proceed through the permitting process.</p>

<p>Some common Sections titles include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A “Team” Section for Pages that contain Fields asking for information about the applicants themselves.</li>
  <li>A “Location” Section for Pages that contain Fields asking for information about the prospective location of the business seeking a permit.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can re-arrange Sections to appear in the sequence you prefer. Just drag them up and down the list using the XX symbol</p>

<p>You can also re-arrange the Pages within each Section---and Fields within each Page--using the same technique. </p>

<p>You can also upload properly structured .csv file to create a new set of Sections entirely.</p>
