<h3>Admin Walkthrough: The "Sections" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Sections are broad groups of <a href="/walkthrough-pages.html">Pages</a>. Their primary purpose is to help applicants understand what kinds of information theyâ€™ll be asked to provide.</p>

<p>Sections also help break up the process, and serve as as milestones for the applicant as they proceed through what can often be a lengthy set of questions and responses.</p>

<p>Thus, you can break up the process into Sections as you see fit. OpenCounter will have been configured with some common default Sections when first launched for your community, but you can add as many as you like. Re-arrange Sections to appear in the sequence you prefer. Just drag them up and down the list</p>

<p>You can also upload properly structured .csv file to create a new set of Sections entirely.</p>

<p>By clicking "Edit", you can view which Pages are contained within each section. You can re-arrange the Pages within each Section---and Fields within each Page--using the same technique described above.</p>
