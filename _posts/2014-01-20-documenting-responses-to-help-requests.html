<h1>A Permit Application has been submitted. Now what?</h1>

<p>OpenCounter will automatically keep track of Help Requests and responses. You'll be able to find a history of this communication on each Request. Actions made by any City user are also tracked under "Admin Papertrail" on the help request page. This concept is also used on all Applications pages.<p>
