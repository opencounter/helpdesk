<h3>Walkthrough: The "Zoning" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Zoning Districts reflect your communityâ€™s Zoning Ordnance. Zoning determines whether businesses within each Use Code are appropriate at any given location.</p>

<p>As most of your staff knows, within each Zoning District, each <a href="/walkthrough-use-codes/html">Use Code</a> is either Permitted (outright or conditionally) or Prohibited. When launched for your organization, the OpenCounter system was configured to match the existing zoning ordinance precisely. Thus, changes to the zoning districts in the OpenCounter system should probably only follow changes to the legally binding zoning ordinance itself.</p>

<p>Each Zoning District also has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An Acronym Code</li>
	<li>A Classification</li>
	<li>A Name</li>
	<li>A Description</li>
	<li>Permissions</li>
</ul>

<p>You can edit any of these attributes at your discretion, simply by clicking the "edit" button and reviewing the information shown in the screenshot below.</p>
