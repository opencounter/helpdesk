<h3>Admin Walkthrough: The "Zoning" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Zoning Districts reflect your communityâ€™s Zoning Ordnance. Zoning determines whether businesses within each Use Code are appropriate at any given location.</p>

<p>These determinations are called Permissions. Within each Zoning District, each Use Code is either Permitted or Prohibited.</p>

<p>Each Zoning District also has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An Acronym Code</li>
	<li>A Classification</li>
	<li>A Name</li>
	<li>A Description</li>
	<li>Permissions</li>
</ul>
