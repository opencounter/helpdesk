<h1>Where can I see which Help Requests have received a response?</h1>

<p>Each help request is associated with an application number that associates inbound requests with an application. Each help request in the /requests menu also includes the ability to mark a request "closed" once you've established contact with the applicant, as well as a "notes" field for you to capture any follow up items.</p>
