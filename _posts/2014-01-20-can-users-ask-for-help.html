<h2>If an end-user gets stuck in the middle of their application, can they ask for help?</h2>

<p>Absolutely. Every end-user can submit a Help Request from any Page. Because each Page of questions is associated with one of your organization's Departments, OpenCounter will route those Help Requests to admin Users that belong to the relevant Department.<p>
