<h3>Admin Walkthrough: The "Fields" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Fields are the building blocks of OpenCounter. They represent a discrete piece of information you are asking from the Applicant. They are then grouped into Pages.</p>

<p>Fields can accept all kinds of information---but it is important for the OpenCounter to know what kind of data you are asking for. Thus, there are 9 different types of Fields.</p>

<p>Each Field can also have 1 - 3 special attributes.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Required Fields must be answered by the Applicant.</li>
	<li>GIS Address Fields make calls to the GIS Server.</li>
	<li>Use Code Fields help determine proper use.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each Field, you can include a “Display lable” for Applicants as well as an internal-facing, “Admin label”. You can also include a “Field placeholder” that will show Applicant’s what type of information you are expecting. Give Applicants additional “Help info” like the kind of file formats you are looking for, if applicable.</p>
