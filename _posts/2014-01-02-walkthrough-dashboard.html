<h3>Admin Walkthrough: The "Dashboard" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">The Dashboard provides your organization with a high-level overview of permit application activity in your community.</p>

<p>The Dashboard has four primary components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An adjustable timeline</li>
  <li>Top-level metrics during the selected timeframe</li>
  <li>A map of permit applications during the selected timeframe.</li>
  <li>A list of all permit applications during the selected timeframe</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken together, these four components create a portrait of business activity in your community.</p>

<p>Adjust the timeframe of data reported by clicking on either end of the light blue area within the timeline at the top of the pages. Data across the rest of th page will update accordingly</p>

<p>Along with the number of Permit Applications initiated and submitted, OpenCounter estimates the total number of jobs created and fees incurred, based on information provided by applicants.</p>

<p>You can also see the status of all applications that exist within the timeframe selected, along with the contact e-mail for each Permit Applicant. To get more details about any particular application, click on the unique "ID" on the left-hand side of the table.</p>
