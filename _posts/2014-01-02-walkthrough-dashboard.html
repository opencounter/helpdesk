<h3>Walkthrough: The "Dashboard" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">The Dashboard provides a high-level overview of permit activity, and provides you access to tools for managing and analyzing permit applications.</p>

<div class="bs-docs-section">
	<div class="page-header">
  		<h4>The Dashboard</h4>
	</div>
		<p>The Dashboard has four primary components:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>An adjustable timeline of activity</li>
		  <li>Top-level metrics during the selected timeframe</li>
		  <li>A map of permit applications during the selected timeframe.</li>
		  <li>A comprehensive list of permit applications during the selected timeframe</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Taken together, these four components create a portrait of business activity in your community. Using the adjustable timeline, you can create snapshots of permit activity for relevant reporting periods.</p>

		<p>Adjust the timeframe of data reported by clicking and dragging either end of the light blue area within the timeline at the top of the page, as shown in the screenshot below. Data across the rest of the page will update accordingly.</p>

		<p>As the screenshot reveals, the Dashboard automatically calculates the total number of jobs created and fees incurred based on information provided by applicants. You'll also see the total number of applications compared to the total number of applications submitted. <a href="/normal-app-complettion-rate.html">It is typical for about 10% of applications initiated to be submitted, but these rates vary across communities.</a></p>

		<p>You can also see the status of all applications that exist within the timeframe selected, along with the contact e-mail for each <b class="term-of-art" id="permit-applicant">Permit Applicant</b>. To get more details about any particular application, click on the unique "ID" on the left-hand side of the table, or click the green "Manage Applications" button at the bottom of the page.</p>

<div class="bs-docs-section">

  		<h4>Managing Applications</h4>
	</div>

    <p class="lead">Here you can find details about all OpenCounter Applications in your community, and take action relevant to individual applications.</p>

    <p>The Applications page is composed of two tables, one displaying all submitted--or finalized--applications, and another showing those still in progress. Each table displays a few high-level attributes such as the business name, the number of answers provided to date, and contact information for the Permit Applicant. Admin users can attach notes to communicate with one another, view help requests submitted by the applicant, or view details for each application.</p>

    <img class="walkthrough-screenshot" src="/assets/img/walkthrough-dashboard-applications-summary.png">

    <p>On each individual Application page, you'll find a map showing the proposed business location, and the <b class="term-of-art" id="zoning-clearance">Zoning Clearance</b> for the proposed use at the proposed location. A table of fees incurred based on application responses, the information provided in response to each Field, and the sequence of Pages visited by the Applicant are also provided.</p>

    <p>In the "Downloads" section toward the bottom of the page, you'll find links to download the "Full Application & GIS Response", as well as any <a href="/walkthrough-forms.html">Forms</a> that Admin Users have created. These Forms are composed of select groups of Applicant answers, often corresponding to <b class="term-of-art" id="existing-permit-form">Existing Permit Forms</b> used within <a href="/walktrhough-departments.html">Departments.</a></p>
