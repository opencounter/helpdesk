<h3>Can I add an existing permit form we use to OpenCounter?</h3>

<p>"Absolutely. Most, if not all, of your existing permit forms were incorporated into OpenCounter at the outset, with your community's Base Install. 

During that process, OpenCounter worked with your organization to break down all (or most) of your existing permit forms into dozens of individual Fields. Each Field is a request for a single piece of information from the end user. 

The Fields from your existing Permits became building blocks for the Pages your citizens currently see.

To add a Permit to OpenCounter, replicate each question asked with a new Field. You may find that some Fields---like those asking for the Applicant's name--already exist in OpenCounter. 

You can either include your new Fields on existing Pages, or you can group your Fields into a new Page or set of Pages. You can also set Rules to determine who should be served the Pages you have created or edited.

The Fields you've added can also be grouped into one or more Forms. These Forms reflect your existing Permit Forms. When an Application has been submitted, you can download each Form individually, collecting only the information you need to process your existing Permit Forms.</p>
