<h3>How will we know when an end-user needs help?</h3>

<p>While some users will be savvy enough to submit a Help Request when they are in need of assistance, we recommend that you also keep an eye on applications that have been started, but never submitted. As well as applications that show "loops' of pages, where the applicants are visiting the same pages over and over again.</p>
