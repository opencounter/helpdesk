<h3>How do I change the order in which we ask questions of permit applicants?</h3>

<p>Yes, on the admin/pages page, each Page has a "Fields" button. When you click that, you'll get a list of all the fields currently assigned to the page. You can grab the arrows â€¡ on the far left to drag and drop those fields into the order that you'd like to see.</p>
