<h3>Walkthrough: The "Users" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">A User is a member of your organization that uses OpenCounter. Departments are groups of Users that take ownership of different permit applications, or sections of the application process.</p>


<div class="bs-docs-section">

  		<h4>Users</h4>
	</div>
	
	<p>Users are the staff that will be administering and using OpenCounter. Users can monitor Applications, respond to <b class="term-of-art" id="help-request">Help Requests</b> on behalf of their Department, and receive <b class="term-of-art" id="metrics-email">Weekly Metrics e-mails</b>. They can also download application data, generate Department-specific forms, and edit the configuration of the permit process your organization shows the public.</p>
