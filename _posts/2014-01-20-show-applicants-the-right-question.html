<h2>How does OpenCounter know which questions to ask applicants?</h2>

<p>OpenCounter shows applicants Pages based on logical rules that your organization can edit at any time. When Applicant responses meet certain criteria or thresholds, the OpenCounter system makes sure they are asked additional questions, and that irrelevant Pages are hidden.</p>
