<h3>Admin Walkthrough: The "Pages" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Pages are just what they sound like---single web pages that Applicantâ€™s view one at a time. You can show them to Applicants based on Visibility Rules.</p>

<p>Each Page is home to one or more Field---that is, one or more piece of information you are asking for from the Applicant. Pages typically host Fields that are related---and thus are titled to reflect a common topic.</p>

<p>Some common Page titles include:</p>
  <ul>
		  <li>Building Owner - this Page might include Fields such as:</li>
    <ul>
			<li>Property Owner First Name</li>
			<li>Property Owner Last Name</li>
			<li>Property Owner Address</li>
			<li>...and so on.</li>
    </ul>
		<li>Business Tax and Licsensing - this Page might include fields such as:</li>
    <ul>
			<li>Business License Application Type</li>
			<li>Business License Exemption Type</li>
			<li>Business License Expiration</li>
			<li>...and so on.</li>
    </ul>
		<li>Major Use Permit - this Page might include fields such as:</li>
    <ul>
			<li>Business Parking Spaces</li>
			<li>Building Stories</li>
			<li>Parcel Prior Use</li>
			<li> ...and on on.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<p>You can also add an Introduction, some Additional Text, and Page Instructions to help the Applicant provide information to each Field.</p>
