<h3>Walkthrough: The "Pages" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Pages are just what they sound like---single web pages that Applicantâ€™s view one at a time. You can show or hide them from Applicants based on Visibility Rules.</p>

<p>Each Page is home to one or more <a href="/walkthrough-fields.html">Field</a>--that is, one or more piece of information you are asking for from the Applicant. Pages typically host Fields that are related---and thus are titled to reflect a common topic.</p>

<p>The screenshot below is a good example of how Pages are organized. The page contains a number of different fields related to a broad topic. Those fields can be re-ordered on the Page so you can craft the right sequence of questions for permit applicants.

<p>For each Page, you can also add an Introduction, some Additional Text, and Page Instructions to help the Applicant provide information to each Field.</p>

<p>The following screencast walks step-by-step through the process of creating and editing Pages:</p>
