<h3>Walkthrough: The "Fees" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Fees reflect your city’s Fee Schedule. People going through the application process are shown an estimate of fees they are likely to incur.</p>

<p>OpenCounter provides municipalities with a flexibile framework for estimating fees. Each Fee you create has some required attributes, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A “Base Cost”.</li>
	<li>An "interval", describing how frequently the fee will be incurred.</li>
	<li>A processing time, to set public expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p>This information lets permit applicants know how much money and time they’ll need to make available for each Fee, and how often.</p>

<p>Fees are often more complex, however. Frequently, fees are calculated based on the type or size of a business or improvement. Thus, OpenCounter allows you to make Fees conditional based on application response.

<p>Fees can be triggered based on Requirements. When an Applicant meets certain conditions, then they alerted that they are responsible for paying the Fee. Requirements are based on the Applicant’s response to the Fields of your choice.</p>
