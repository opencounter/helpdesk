<h3>How can we keep track of who has emailed an Applicant?</h3>

<p>OpenCounter will automatically keep track of Help Requests and responses. You'll be able to find a history of this communication on each Application page, under "Admin Papertrail," as well as by color coding each application as "open" or "closed." </p>
