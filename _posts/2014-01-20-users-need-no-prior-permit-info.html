<h1>Do end-users need to know which permit they are seeking?</h1>

<p>No. OpenCounter allows you to ask each Applicant the right questions based on their answers to previous questions, and avoid showing them questions that aren't relevant. It's an easy and intuitive system that requires no prior knowledge of which permits are required of them.</p>
