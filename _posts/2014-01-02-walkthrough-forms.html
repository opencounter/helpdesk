<h3>Walkthrough: The "Forms" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Forms are a way to replicate your existing permitting process within OpenCounter.</p>

<p>Applicant responses solicited from any set of Fields can be grouped into a Form. When an Application is submitted, youâ€™ll be able to download each Form---or group of answers---in order to easily match up with your existing permitting process and workflows.</p>
