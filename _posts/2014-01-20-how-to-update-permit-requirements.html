<h1>We have changed the requirements for a permit. How do I reflect this change in OpenCounter?</h1>

<p>There are a number of ways you might want to update OpenCounter to reflect a change in what is required to obtain a permit:

- Update a Fee

Updating Fees is straightforward. If a Fee has changed, log in to admin section of OpenCounter. Navigate to the Fees page. Find the appropriate Fee, and click edit. Change the magnitude of the Fee, or the conditions on which it is triggered, and click Save.

- Remove Fields from a Page

If a piece of information is no longer required, you can update the relevant Pages. Log in to the admin section of OpenCounter. Navigate to the Pages page. Click on Fields, which shows the number of Fields included on that Page. You'll see a list of Fields currently included on the Page.  Simply click Remove to eliminate a Field.

- Add a New Field and Add it to a Page

If a new piece of information is required, you'll need to create that Field ""globally"" before adding it to the proper Page. Log in to the admin section of OpenCounter. Navigate to the Fields page. Scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, and click the green ""New Field"" button. From there, you can determine what kind of response you are looking for, author some help text, and determine whether the Field is required, among other things. To learn more about Fields, click here.

Once you've created a new Field ""globally"" you can add it to a specific Page. Navigate to the Pages section of the Admin interface, and choose the Page you would like to edit, and then click the Edit button. In the middle of the next page, you'll find a section where you can add Fields for display. Click the green ""Add Field"" button, and viola!
