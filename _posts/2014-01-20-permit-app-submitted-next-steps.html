<h1>A Permit Application has been submitted. Now what?</h1>

<p>Once a permit application is submitted in OpenCounter, you can download the entire application, as well as smaller groups of information that reflect each of your existing permit forms. Navigate to your Dashboard, scroll to the bottom of the Page, and click "Manage Applications". A list of submitted applications will be shown. Click on any application you would like to download, then scroll to the bottom of the page to the Downloads section. Download the files you need, and process the application through your existing systems that operate alongside OpenCounter.<p>
