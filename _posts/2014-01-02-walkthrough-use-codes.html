<h3>Admin Walkthrough: The "Use Codes" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Use Codes are used to classify proposed businesses for zoning evaluation.</p>

<p>Use Codes help OpenCounter determine whether an Applicant is allowed to pursue their business at a given location, whether they need to meet additional requirements, or whether the proposed use is prohibited.</p>

<p>Each Use Code has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A numerical code</li>
	<li>An Industry</li>
	<li>A Sub-Industry</li>
	<li>A Specific use</li>
	<li>Associated keywords</li>
</ul>

<p>Use Codes are often reflective of national business classifications standards like SIC or NAICS Codes.</p>

<p>Each Zoning District or special district has a judgement for each different Use Code.</p>
