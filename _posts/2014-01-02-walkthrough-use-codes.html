<h3>Walkthrough: The "Use Codes" Area</h3>

<p class="lead">Use Codes are used to classify proposed businesses for zoning evaluation.</p>

<p>Use Codes help OpenCounter determine whether an Applicant is allowed to pursue their business at a given location, whether they need to meet additional requirements, or whether the proposed use is prohibited. 

<p>When OpenCounter is first configured for your community, Use Codes are derived from your municipality's zoning ordinance. Thus, Use Codes will typically only be added or edited when there is a change to the zoning code.

<p>Each Use Code has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A numerical code</li>
	<li>An Industry</li>
	<li>A Sub-Industry</li>
	<li>A Specific use</li>
	<li>Associated keywords</li>
</ul>

<p>You can edit any of these attributes manually by clicking the "Edit" button for any Use Code. You can also view the relevant Permissions for any given Use Code. By clicking "Permissions", you'll see the specific zoning clearances for each district, as well as map showing where each permission is in effect.</p>
