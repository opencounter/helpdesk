<h1>What is the minimum amount of information that end-users need to provide to use OpenCounter?</h1>

<p>Most permits require at least a few pieces of information, but we recommend that you limit the number of Fields you mark as ""required"" to only the must-haves. As a rule of thumb, the following pieces of information often constitute the bare minimum:

1. General Applicant contact data (Name, Phone, Address)
2. email Address
3. Business Name
4. Prospective Business Address
5. Use Code for the Prospective Business</p>
