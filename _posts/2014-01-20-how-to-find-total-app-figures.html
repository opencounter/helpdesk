<h3>Can I see the total number of permit applications initiated or submitted in a given time period?</h3>

<p>Absolutely. Naviage to admin/dashboard, and use the top bar graph "brushes" to select any time period so that you can see the number of started and completed applications, the number of jobs estimated contained in those applications, and the amount of total fee activity they represent.</p>
