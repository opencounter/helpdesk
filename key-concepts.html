  <!-- Key Concepts
  ================================================== -->  

  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="concepts-introduction-to-rules">Use Rules to Route Applications and Assign Fees</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Rules allow OpenCounter to take the complex, related permitting processes required to start a business, and translate them into a straightforward, easy-to-navigate experience for permit Applicants.</p>

    <p>Rules embody the logic of your internal permitting processes. When an Applicant provides answers to questions that meet certain conditions or criteria, the rules you set will trigger a response that takes that answer into consideration.</p>

    <p>There are two different uses of Rules in OpenCounter:</p>

    <div class="row bs-examples">
      <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-6">
        <a class="thumbnail">
          <!-- return img src to root when you decide on a domain -->
          <img src="/docs-assets/img/dummy-example.jpg" alt>
        </a>
        <h4>Visibility Rules</h4>
        <p>In other words, the rule determines whether an Applicant needs to answer a set of questions, or not, based on previous answers provided.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-6">
        <a class="thumbnail">
          <!-- return img src to root when you decide on a domain -->
          <img src="/docs-assets/img/dummy-example.jpg" alt>
        </a>
        <h4>Fee Requirement Rules</h4>
        <p>In other words, the rule determines whether an Applicant needs to answer a set of questions, or not, based on previous answers provided.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>There are two also two distinct types of rule, which can be used in either context described above:</p>

    <div class="row bs-examples">
      <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-6">
        <a class="thumbnail">
          <!-- return img src to root when you decide on a domain -->
          <img src="/docs-assets/img/dummy-example.jpg" alt>
        </a>
        <h4>Conditional Rules</h4>
        <p>Conditional Rules deal with the value of responses provided by Applicants. Often times, certain questions must be answered (or fees must be paid) if a value or greater than or less than a certain threshold.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-6 col-md-6">
        <a class="thumbnail">
          <!-- return img src to root when you decide on a domain -->
          <img src="/docs-assets/img/dummy-example.jpg" alt>
        </a>
        <h4>Yes or No Rules</h4>
        <p>Yes or No Rules deal with the Use Code, Zoning District, or Zoning Clearance associated with the application. They are simple “yes” or “no” rules based on one of those attributes.</p>

  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="concepts-users-and-departments">The Role of Admin Users and Departments</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">List each Department involved in the permitting process, and create AdminUser Accounts for Department staff that will be using OpenCounter.</p>

    <p>Each Admin User Account has the authority to accomplish the following tasks:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Request information from Applicants, by creating or editing Fields.</li>
      <li>Monitor or download permit application activity using the Dashboard</li>
      <li>Create and edit Forms for download that reflect their Department's Existing Permit Forms</li>
      <li>Receive and respond to Help Requests from Applicants on behalf of their Department.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each Admin User should be associated with one or more Departments. This attribute will ensure they receive relevant Help Requests from citizen and Form Downloads when applications are submitted.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="concepts-fields-to-create-pages">Using Fields to Build Pages and Sections</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Fields are the building blocks of the OpenCounter system. Each Field is a request for a single piece of information.</p>

    <p>When OpenCounter was first set up in your community, each Existing Permit Form used across the local permitting process was collected. These Existing Permit Forms came from many different Departments, so they often requested the same information--like names, contact information, and address--from Permit Applicants.</p>

    <p>With OpenCounter, you only need to collect each piece of information once. Each Existing Permit Form was broken down into many individual Fields--or requests for a piece of information.</p>

    <p>In the OpenCounter system, each Field can appear anywhere in the permitting process. If a Field needs to appear twice, it can--but the information first submitted by the Applicant will show up, so they know their responses have been captured.</p>

    <p>Related Fields are grouped into single Pages. Pages can also be grouped into Sections. This communicates--at the outset--what kinds of information Permit Applicants are expected to provide. You have complete control over the order in which Sections appear, and the order of Pages within Sections, and the order of Fields on each Page--giving you the ability to tailor the Permit Application experience at your discretion.</p>

    <p>Moreover, you can determine which Permit Applicants see each Page--and by extension, which Fields you ask that they complete. Using logical rules like those described above, you can show certain pages to certain applicants based on answers they provide, or the location of their propospective business.</p>

  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="concepts-fields-to-create-forms">Re-create Your Forms using Completed Fields</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">OpenCounter enables you to easily extract individual pieces information collected from Permit Applicants, and group them into downloadable Forms that match your existing workflow.</p>

    <p>As described above, OpenCounter allows you to use Fields--requests for individual pieces of information--as flexible building blocks to create simple, easy-to-understand permit application process.</p>

    <p>However, what is easiest for Permit Applicants will not always match with your Existing Permit Forms and internal workflow.</p>

    <p>As a result, OpenCounter allows Admin Users to create "Forms" that reflect their respective Departments' existing workflow. These Forms can be downloaded when an application is submitted, providing Departments with the information they need to keep their existing workflow running smoothly.

  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="concepts-use-codes-and-zoning-districts">Use Codes, Zoning Districts, and Zoning Clearances (Permissions)</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Use Codes are used to classify prospective businesses, and check whether they are permitted in any given Zoning District</p>

    <p>Two critical pieces of information should be asked from each Permit Applicant:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An address for their prospective business</li>
      <li>A classification of their prospective business by Use Code</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use Codes are often extracted from your municipality's Zoning Ordinance. Once an address and a Use Code have been supplied by the Permit Applicant, the OpenCounter platform can provide instantaneous feedback about whether the proposed use is allowed in the given location.</p>

    <div class="row bs-examples">
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">

        <h4>A Zoning Clearance Map</h4>
        <p>Each Zoning District contains a judgement, or Zoning Clearance (Permission), for every business Use Code. By default, OpenCounter contains three different Zoning Clearances:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Permitted</li>
        	<li>Prohibited</li>
        	<li>“C” for Conditional</li>

  <div class="bs-docs-section">
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 id="concepts-fees">Calculating Fees for Applicants</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Re-create your municipal Fee schedule to estimate revenue and given Permit Applicants an estimate of costs they will incur.</p>

    <p>In the OpenCounter system, Fees operate similarly to Fields. Your municipality's existing Fee Schedule might contain dozens of different fees for different aspects of the permitting process. Using logical rules, OpenCounter makes it easy to identify which Fees should apply to each Permit Applicant.</p>

    <p>Each Fee can be triggered based on answers provided by Permit Applicants, or aspects of their prospective business. Fees can also be recalculated based on the specific values of Applicant responses---such as the size of a building or signage. While going through the OpenCounter system, Permit Applicants will be shown a running tally of fees to be incurred. Similarly, Admin Users will be shown the estimated fees incurred by any given Applicant--and by all Applicants taken together--in the Admin Dashboard.
