<h3>Glossary of Terms</h3>

<p class="lead">A guide to terms used throughout OpenCounter.</p>

<ul class="glossary-list">
	<ul class="glossary-list">
	<h4>Applications</h4>
		<li>
			<h5>"Application"</h5>
			<p>An 'application' refers to any OpenCounter session initiated by a member of the public. In OpenCounter, an 'application' refers to <em>all</em>information and responses an applicant needs to provide to accomplish their goal--even if that may require securing multiple <a>Existing Permits</a></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>"Applicant" or "Permit Applicant"</h5>
			<p>An applicant or permit applicant refers to any member of the public that has initiated an OpenCounter session. Oftentimes, applicants are only using OpenCounter to learn more information--not all applicants will submit an application.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>"Help Requests", "Notes" and the "Admin Papertrail"</h5>
			<p>Help Requests are submitted by applicants when they are in need of assistance during an OpenCounter session. Help Requests are routed to all of the <a>Admin Users</a> in a particular <a>Department</a>depending on which <a>Page</a> the applicant needs help with--that way, people are connected with the staff that can help, and staff doesn't have worry about routing questions to the right person. Notes are recorded by Admin Users to document communication with applicants--whether that was a response to a Help Request, or a proactive message sent to people with applicants in-progress. The Admin Papertrail is a log of all notes add by all Admin Users, which can be reviewed on an application by application basis.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>"Forms" and "Downloads"</h5>
			<p>OpenCounter Forms reflect your organization's <a>Existing Permit Forms</a>. When OpenCounter was first configured in your community, all Existing Permit Forms were collected, and broken down into their component <a>fields</a>. To create a form in OpenCounter, simply group together the fields that compose each existing permit form. When an application is submitted, your staff will be able to download exactly the information needed for each permit process in the "Download" section.</p>
		</li>

	<h4>Zoning</h4>
		<li>
			<h5>"Zoning District"</h5>
			<p>The zoning districts in OpenCounter we're configured to reflect your community's zoning ordinance. They are geographic districts that determine what kind of land use is appropriate in a given location. In OpenCounter, zoning districts provide a <a>zoning clearance</a> for each <a>use code</a>.
