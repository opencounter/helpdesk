    </div>
    <p class="lead">One of the most powerful aspects of the OpenCounter permitting system is the ability to quickly and easily understand important economic trends in your community.</p>

    <p>Using the Dashboard, a user can get aggregate figures for the total number of permit applications intitiated, applications submitted, employment generated, and fees incurred. The adjustable timeline makes it easy to report on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis--or any custom period you may be interested in.</p>

    <p>As you adjust the timeline, aggregate data displayed on the Dashboard changes, along with the map. This allows your staff to see what kind of application activity is happening where. This spatial understanding of permit activity can be very valuable in zoning, land use, and economic development conversations.</p>

    <p>While fees incurred and employment generated are key metrics for most municipalities, we also recommend taking a close look at the ratio of the total applications submitted compared to the total number of applications initiated. This can be a valuable internal metric for evaluating how effectively your OpenCounter permitting process is configured.

    </div>
    <p class="lead">Reviewing Applications gives your staff a detailed understanding of business activity in your community, and empowers them to provide excellent customer service.</p>

    <p>Each application initiatd or submitted through OpenCounter contains a wealth of information. The details of each application can help your staff provide support through the permitting process, and give your Department a better understanding of applicant needs generally.</p>

    <p>First and foremost, you'll find an e-mail address associated with each applications. Your staff can use this contact information to proactively get in touch with applicants who appear to be stalled, or from whom you'd like to solicit additional information.</p>

    <p>On each application page, you'll also l find a list of fees incurred based on answers provided by the applicant to date. Fees can provide a detailed picture of the physical aspects of a proposed business, such as the square footage, signage, and infrastructure requirements. In aggregate, the regularity with which Fees are incurred can give your organization an understanding of important business trends in your community.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="lead">Help Requests are the primary way Permit Applicants solicit support from your staff.</p>

    <p>On any given Page in the OpenCounter process, Permit Applicants are able to submit a Help Request. This simple message is then routed to Admin Users associated with the relevant Department.</p>

    <p>We recommend that you respond to Help Requests as soon as possible to acknowledge their reciept. Each request can serve as the beginning of a dialogue between the Permit Applicant and your staff.</p>

    <p>This screencast walks step-by-step through the process of responding to and closing a Help Request:</p>
